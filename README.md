# Cloudinary React Video Player

React (stand-alone) component that implements the new [cloudinary-video-player](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-video-player) as a react component.  

Note: this should not be confused with [cloudinary-react](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-react) which also includes a `Video` component but does not implement  [cloudinary-video-player](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-video-player), instead it uses the default (and much more limited) HTML5 video player.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
